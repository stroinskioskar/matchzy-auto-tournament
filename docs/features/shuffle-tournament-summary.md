> **Implementation status**: See [Shuffle Tournament Implementation Verification](./shuffle-tournament-implementation-verification.md)

## Overview

Shuffle tournaments introduce a tournament type where players compete **individually**, and teams are **re-balanced automatically before each round** based on ELO. The tournament winner is the player with the most match wins, with ELO and ADR used as tie-breakers.

## Core Problem Statement

### Current System Limitations

The current tournament system is designed around **fixed teams**:

- Teams are created with a fixed roster of players
- Teams remain consistent throughout the tournament
- Tournament progression tracks team wins/losses
- Map veto system is team-based

### User's Use Case

- **Event**: LAN Party with ~60 players
- **Challenge**: Wide range of player skill levels (ELO differences)
- **Current Workaround**: Manual Excel sheet that:
  - Tracks individual player ELO values
  - Calculates average team ELO
  - Attempts to balance teams (5 players per team) with similar average ELO
  - Records match results per player
- **Goal**: Individual players compete, not teams. Player with most match wins wins the tournament.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Match Structure

- **Format**: Best of 1 (BO1) - single map per match
- **Team size**: 5 players per team (5v5 matches)
- **No knife round**: Sides are assigned randomly, no knife round for side selection
- **No veto system**: Map veto is completely bypassed
- **Random side assignment**: Team sides (CT/T) are randomly assigned per match

### 2. Dynamic Team Composition

- **No fixed teams**: Players should not be permanently assigned to teams
- **Core implementation approach**: "Not fixing Player IDs to Teams" - players are not bound to specific team entities
- **Shuffled teams per match**: Teams are formed dynamically for each match
- **Flexible player assignment**: Any player can join any server/match (players can join any available server)
- **Team balancing**: Teams should be balanced by ELO/skill level (5 players per team with similar average ELO)

### 3. Map Management

- **Fixed map per round**: All matches in a round use the same map
- **Round-based progression**: Maps are assigned sequentially per round
  - Example: Round 1 → all matches use `de_dust2`
  - Round 2 → all matches use `de_mirage`
  - Round 3 → all matches use `de_inferno`
  - And so on...
- **Admin-controlled**: Maps are predetermined for each round during tournament setup
- **No map voting**: Map veto system is completely disabled for this tournament type

### 4. Round Synchronization

- **Round completion requirement**: All matches in a round must complete before the next round can begin
- **Synchronized progression**: The tournament waits for all teams to finish their matches in the current round before advancing
- **Match coordination**: System must track round completion status and prevent premature round advancement

### 5. Individual Player Tracking

- **Player-centric scoring**: Track wins/losses per individual player (not teams)
- **No team winner**: Tournament winner is the individual player with most match wins
- **Player statistics**: Track individual performance across all matches
- **ELO tracking**: Track and update individual player ELO values based on match performance

### 6. Match Creation

- Shuffle tournaments use the standard tournament lifecycle (setup → in progress → completed) without a bracket tree.
- Matches are created **automatically** for each round based on registered players and configured team size.
- Teams are assigned automatically using the team-balancing algorithm, and players are whitelisted via MatchZy match configs.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution A: Simple Implementation (Priority for Initial Release)

**Description**: Basic match creation without tournament bracket structure - **Target: Dec 27th for LAN Party**

**Features**:

- **Match Creation**: Allow match creation **without requiring a tournament tree/bracket**
  - Can create individual matches without creating a full tournament
  - Admin creates 6 matches manually between each round
- **Player Registration** (Optional):
  - Bulk import of Steam IDs via CSV/JSON
  - Player whitelisting not required (players can join without being whitelisted)
  - Even number of players expected (no sub in/out needed)
- **Player Names**: Admin can set custom player names (already works)
- **Player Avatars** (Low Priority):
  - Set custom avatars per player or per team
  - Does not contribute to gameplay functionality
- **Player Dashboard** (Low Priority):
  - Can communicate connection URLs through Discord/website instead
- **Maps**:
  - Choose from map pool (pre-assigned maps not critical)
  - Fixed map per round simplifies tournament management
- **Round Creation**: **MANUAL** - Admin creates new round after previous round finishes
- **Team Formation**: **MANUAL** - Admin manually assigns players/teams to each match
  - No auto-assignment (relies on Excel ELO calculations)
  - Player assignment optional (players can join correct server/side themselves)
- **Round Progression**: **MANUAL TRIGGER** - Admin manually triggers next round
  - All matches must finish before next round can start
  - System tracks round completion but doesn't auto-advance
- **Win Condition**: Not needed (relies on Excel sheet for tracking)
- **Match Stat Overview** (Priority 2):
  - **Critical**: Display ADR (Average Damage per Round) or Total Damage per player after match
  - **Alternative**: Export stats to webhook/Discord/JSON/CSV after match ends
  - Currently players screenshot stats and send to admins

**Pros**:

- Faster to implement (target Dec 27th)
- Allows user to maintain their existing Excel-based tournament tree
- Minimal changes to existing system
- Works with current ELO calculation workflow

  - Algorithm balances teams by average ELO
  - Forms teams of 5 players with similar total ELO
  - Assigns balanced teams to matches
- **Match Scheduling**:
  - Automatic match creation and team assignment
  - Players matched based on ELO and availability
- **Individual Player Leaderboard**:
  - Track match wins per player
  - Display player statistics (ELO, wins, losses, performance metrics)

**Pros**:

- Fully automated system
- Better player experience
- Leverages platform capabilities
- Scalable for large events

**Cons**:

- More complex to implement
- Requires ELO algorithm design
- Needs team balancing algorithm

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Changes

- **Player ELO tracking**: New table or fields to store:
  - Player ELO values
  - ELO history/changes
  - Player match statistics
- **Match structure**: May need to support matches without fixed `team1_id`/`team2_id`
- **Player assignments**: Track which players were on which team for each match

### Match Configuration

- **Match format**: BO1 (Best of 1) - single map per match
- **Team assignment**: Dynamic team assignment at match creation time (5 players per team)
- **Map configuration**:
  - Fixed map per round (all matches in round use same map)
  - No veto system - maps are predetermined
  - Map sequence defined during tournament setup
- **Side assignment**: Random CT/T assignment (no knife round)
- **Player tracking**: Track individual players across matches, not just teams
- **Round synchronization**: System must ensure all matches in a round complete before advancing

### UI/UX Changes

## Match Flow Example

### Simple Solution Workflow (Manual Process)

#### Round 1 Setup (Admin Actions)

1. **Admin creates 6 matches manually** (for 60 players = 6 matches of 5v5)
   - No tournament tree needed - just create individual matches
2. **Admin manually assigns players/teams** to each match
   - Uses Excel sheet to calculate balanced teams based on ELO
   - Assigns 5 players to team1, 5 players to team2 for each match
   - OR assigns existing teams if using team system
3. **Admin selects map** for round 1 (e.g., `de_dust2`)
   - All 6 matches will use this same map
4. **Sides**: Randomly assigned per match (no knife round)

#### Round 1 Execution

- All 6 matches play simultaneously (or as servers allow)
- Each match is BO1 on `de_dust2`
- Sides are randomly assigned per match
- Players join servers (whitelisting optional)

#### Round 1 Completion

- System tracks when **all 6 matches** complete
- After each match: **ADR or Total Damage displayed per player**
- Admin can export stats to webhook/Discord/JSON/CSV
- Admin updates ELO in Excel sheet based on match results

#### Round 2 Setup (After Round 1 Completes - Admin Actions)

1. **Admin manually triggers "Create Next Round"** button
2. **Admin creates 6 new matches** for round 2
3. **Admin manually assigns players/teams** again
   - Uses updated ELO from Excel to balance teams
   - Players reshuffled into new balanced teams
4. **Admin selects map** for round 2 (e.g., `de_mirage`)
   - All 6 matches will use this same map
5. **Sides**: Randomly assigned again

#### Round 2 Execution

- All matches play on `de_mirage`
- Process repeats

#### Tournament Winner

- Tracked in Excel sheet (not in system for simple solution)
- Player with **most match wins** across all rounds wins
- Individual player leaderboard (handled externally)

### Complex Solution Workflow (Future - Automated)

#### Round 1 Setup (Automatic)

- **System automatically creates matches** based on player count
- **System automatically balances teams** using ELO algorithm
- **System automatically assigns map** for round 1
- **Sides**: Randomly assigned

#### Round 1 Execution

- All matches play simultaneously
- Individual player results tracked

#### Round 1 Completion (Automatic)

- System detects all matches complete
- **System automatically updates ELO** for all players
- **System automatically reshuffles teams** based on new ELO
- **System automatically advances to next round**

#### Round 2 Setup (Automatic)

- **System automatically creates new matches** with reshuffled teams
- **System automatically assigns map** for round 2
- Process continues automatically

#### Tournament Winner

- **System tracks match wins** per player
- **System displays leaderboard** with ELO, wins, stats
- Player with most match wins wins tournament

# Shuffle Tournament Type - Complex Solution

## Overview

This document details the **complex solution** for implementing a shuffle tournament type where players are dynamically reassigned to teams for each match based on ELO ratings. This solution provides full automation of team balancing, ELO calculation, and match progression.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike the simple solution which relies on manual team assignment and external Excel-based ELO tracking, the complex solution provides a fully integrated, automated system.

## Core Concept

- **Individual Player Competition**: Players compete individually, not as fixed teams
- **Dynamic Team Formation**: Teams are automatically formed and balanced before each round
- **ELO-Based Balancing**: Teams are balanced by average ELO to ensure fair matchups
- **Fully Automatic System**: System handles everything automatically - no manual intervention required
- **Automatic Progression**: System automatically advances rounds, reshuffles teams, and updates ELO
- **Player-Centric Scoring**: Tournament winner is the individual player with most match wins
- **Player Whitelisting**: Players must be whitelisted to join servers (prevents unauthorized players from disrupting matches)

## Match Structure

### Format

- **Match Type**: Best of 1 (BO1) - single map per match
- **Team Size**: Configurable players per team (default: 5 for 5v5 matches)
  - Admin can set team size during tournament creation
  - Common options: 4v4, 5v5, 6v6
  - Minimum: 2 players per team
  - Maximum: 10 players per team (practical limit)
- **Side Assignment**: Random CT/T assignment (no knife round)
- **Veto System**: Completely disabled - no map voting

### Round Configuration

- **Round Limit Options**:
  - **Option 1**: Play until 13 rounds (first to 13 wins)
  - **Option 2**: Use max rounds limit (default: 24 rounds)
    - If max rounds reached, winner determined by current score
- **Admin Configuration**: Admin selects round limit during tournament setup
  - Choose between "First to 13" or "Max Rounds" (with configurable limit)
  - Default: Max Rounds = 24

### Overtime Handling

- **Overtime Configuration** (when max rounds reached):
  - **Option 1**: Enable Overtime
    - Standard CS2 overtime rules (MR3 format - first to 4 rounds with 10k start money)
    - Continue until winner determined
    - ✅ **Implemented**: MR3 overtime configuration is set via cvars in match config
  - **Option 2**: Stop at Max Rounds
    - Match ends when max rounds reached
    - Winner determined by current score
    - ✅ **Implemented**: Overtime is disabled when this mode is selected
- **Admin Configuration**: Admin selects overtime handling during tournament setup
  - Default: Enable Overtime (standard CS2 rules)
- **Implementation Status**: 
  - ✅ Overtime mode selection is stored in database and applied to MatchZy match config via cvars
  - ✅ MR3 format (first to 4 rounds, 10k start money) is configured via `mp_overtime_maxrounds` and `mp_overtime_startmoney` cvars
  - ✅ Round limit configuration: "First to 13" uses 24 max rounds, "Max Rounds" uses configured value

### Map Management

- **Fixed Map Per Round**: All matches in a round use the same predetermined map
- **Sequential Map Progression**: Maps progress sequentially through rounds
  - Round 1: Map 1 (e.g., `de_dust2`)
  - Round 2: Map 2 (e.g., `de_mirage`)
  - Round 3: Map 3 (e.g., `de_inferno`)
  - Continues through selected maps
- **Map Selection**: Admin selects maps during tournament setup
- **Number of Rounds**: Number of maps selected = number of rounds to be played
  - Example: Admin selects 5 maps → Tournament will have 5 rounds
  - Simple and straightforward - no complex round calculations

### Round Synchronization

- **Round Completion Requirement**: All matches in a round must complete before next round begins
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects when all matches in a round are complete
- **Automatic Advancement**: System automatically advances to next round (no manual trigger needed)

## Core Features

### 1. Rating System (ELO or OpenSkill)

> **Background – What are ELO and OpenSkill?**  
> - **ELO**: Classic rating system from chess – each player has a single number that goes up or down after each game based on who they played and whether they won or lost.  
> - **OpenSkill**: A modern Bayesian rating system for competitive games (similar family to Microsoft TrueSkill) that handles **teams**, changing teammates, and uncertainty much better than plain ELO. See the official docs at [openskill.me](https://openskill.me) for a deeper explanation.  
> - In this design, admins still work with an **Elo-style Skill Rating** (centered around 1500), while the system can internally run OpenSkill and convert between Skill Rating and OpenSkill values.

#### Rating System Options

**Option A: Standard Chess ELO** (Simpler)

- Traditional ELO system
- Single number per player
- Simple to understand and implement
- See [ELO Package Research](./elo-package-research.md)

**Option B: OpenSkill** (Recommended - Superior)

- **20x faster** than TrueSkill
- Better for team-based games
- Bayesian uncertainty tracking (sigma)
- Supports asymmetric teams
- See [OpenSkill Integration](./openskill-integration.md) for details

**Recommendation**: Use **OpenSkill** with simplified admin interface (admins still set "ELO" numbers, system converts internally)

#### Rating Management

- **Initial Rating Assignment**:
  - Admin can set starting Skill Rating for each player individually
  - Support for bulk import of starting ratings
  - **Default Starting Skill Rating**: 1500 (OpenSkill ordinal ≈ 0 mapped to 1500)
    - Applied automatically when no rating is specified during player creation
    - Used when creating players from Players page without rating
    - Used when creating players from Teams page without rating
    - Used when bulk importing players without rating field
  - There is no longer a configurable global “Default Player ELO” slider; instead the system uses the fixed Skill Rating mapping.
  - Import from existing system/Excel (future enhancement)

- **Editing Player ELO After Creation**:
  - Admins can edit a player's ELO after the player has been created
  - Accessible through the Players page by clicking on a player card
  - **Warning System**: When changing a player's ELO, a confirmation dialog appears warning that:
    - The change will reset the player's stats and rating history
    - This action cannot be undone
  - The warning shows the old and new ELO values for confirmation
  - If the admin cancels, the ELO field resets to the original value
  - Use with caution - typically only needed for correcting initial ELO values or resetting a player's rating

#### Rating Calculation

**If Using ELO**:

- **Chess-Style ELO System**:
  - Uses standard chess ELO calculation formula
  - ELO updates based on **team result** (win or loss)
  - Individual player gets win/loss based on their team's result
  - No individual performance adjustment - purely win/loss based
- **Calculation Factors**:
  - Player's current ELO
  - Opponent team's average ELO
  - Match result (1 for win, 0 for loss)
  - K-factor (sensitivity of ELO changes, typically 32)

**If Using OpenSkill** (Recommended):

- **OpenSkill System**:
  - Uses Weng-Lin Bayesian approximation method
  - Updates based on **team result** (win or loss)
  - Tracks uncertainty (sigma) - decreases with more matches
  - Better handling of team-based scenarios
  - Faster calculations
- **Admin Interface**: Admins still set single "ELO" number
  - System automatically converts to OpenSkill (mu, sigma)
  - Display converts back to "ELO" for familiarity
  - See [OpenSkill Integration](./openskill-integration.md) for conversion details

#### ELO Formula (If Using ELO)

- **Standard Chess ELO Formula**:

  ```
  Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_avg_elo - player_elo) / 400))
  ELO Change = K * (Actual - Expected)

  Where:
  - K = K-factor (typically 32, configurable)
  - Actual = 1 if team won, 0 if team lost
  - Expected = Expected probability of winning based on ELO difference
  ```

- **Simplified Approach**:
  - Player's ELO changes based solely on whether their team won or lost
  - Individual performance metrics (ADR, damage, etc.) do not affect ELO
  - Keeps system simple and fair - team result determines ELO change

#### OpenSkill Formula (If Using OpenSkill)

- **OpenSkill Rating Update**:

  - Uses `rate()` function from `openskill` package
  - Input: Teams with player ratings (mu, sigma)
  - Output: Updated ratings for all players
  - Handles team results automatically
  - See [OpenSkill Integration](./openskill-integration.md) for implementation

- **Rating History**: Track all rating changes with timestamps and match references

#### Stat-Based ELO Adjustments (Optional)

- **Hybrid Rating System**:
  - **Base Rating**: OpenSkill calculates base ELO change based on team win/loss (pure Bayesian rating)
  - **Stat Adjustments**: Optional stat-based adjustments applied as post-processing step
  - **Final ELO**: Base ELO + stat adjustments = final displayed ELO

- **Default Behavior**: Pure OpenSkill (no stat adjustments)
  - Only team win/loss affects ELO
  - Individual performance stats tracked but not used in rating
  - Simple, fair, and statistically sound

- **ELO Calculation Templates**:
  - Admins can create custom templates defining how stats affect ELO
  - Templates specify weights for each stat (kills, deaths, assists, ADR, etc.)
  - Templates can be enabled/disabled per tournament
  - See [ELO Calculation Templates](./elo-calculation-templates.md) for detailed design

- **Available Stats for Adjustment**:
  - Kills, Deaths, Assists
  - Flash Assists, Headshot Kills
  - Damage, Utility Damage
  - KAST, MVPs, Score
  - ADR (Average Damage per Round)

- **Template Examples**:
  - **Pure Win/Loss** (default): No stat adjustments
  - **Kill-Focused**: Rewards fragging (kills, headshots, MVPs)
  - **Support-Focused**: Rewards support play (assists, utility, KAST)
  - **Balanced Performance**: Balanced approach rewarding all aspects

- **Implementation**:
  - Templates stored in `elo_calculation_templates` table
  - Tournament references template via `elo_template_id`
  - Rating history stores both base ELO and stat adjustments
  - Both values available for analysis and transparency

### 2. Automatic Team Assignment

#### Team Balancing Algorithm

- **Goal**: Create balanced teams of 5 players with similar average ELO
- **Algorithm Requirements**:
  - Use established, trialed-and-tested formulas (research online)
  - Balance by average ELO (teams should have similar total/average ELO)
  - Minimize ELO variance within teams
  - Handle edge cases (odd number of players, very high/low ELO players)
- **Approach Options**:
  - Greedy algorithm (assign highest ELO to team with lowest average)
  - Genetic algorithm (optimize for balanced teams)
  - Round-robin pairing with ELO consideration
  - Research existing team balancing algorithms for competitive gaming

#### Team Formation Process

1. Get all registered players for tournament
2. Sort players by current ELO
3. Apply team balancing algorithm to create balanced pairs of teams
4. Assign teams to matches
5. Ensure all players are assigned to exactly one match per round

#### Edge Cases

- **Odd Number of Players**:
  - Option 1: One player sits out (rotate each round)
  - Option 2: Create one team with 4 players (handicap system)
  - Option 3: Allow spectator/substitute role
- **Very High/Low ELO Players**:
  - Ensure they're distributed across matches
  - Prevent all high ELO players on one team
- **Player Availability**:
  - Track player availability/status
  - Handle players who can't play a round

### 3. Automatic Match Creation

#### Match Generation

- **Automatic Creation**: System automatically creates matches for each round
- **Match Count Calculation**:
  - Based on number of registered players and team size
  - Formula: `Math.floor(playerCount / (teamSize * 2))` matches per round
  - Example: 60 players with 5v5 (teamSize=5) = `Math.floor(60 / 10)` = 6 matches per round
  - Example: 40 players with 4v4 (teamSize=4) = `Math.floor(40 / 8)` = 5 matches per round
- **Match Assignment**:
  - Automatically assign balanced teams to matches
  - Assign map for the round
  - Assign random sides (CT/T)
  - Generate match configs

#### Match Configuration

- **BO1 Format**: Single map per match
- **No Veto**: Skip veto system completely
- **Fixed Map**: Use predetermined map for round
- **Random Sides**: Randomly assign CT/T sides
- **Round Limit**:
  - Configurable: "First to 13" or "Max Rounds" (default: 24)
  - Set during tournament creation
- **Overtime Handling**:
  - Configurable: Enable Overtime, or Stop at Max Rounds
  - Set during tournament creation
  - Default: Enable Overtime (standard CS2 MR3 format)
- **Player Assignment**: Assign players to teams based on team balancing
- **Player Whitelisting**: All assigned players are automatically whitelisted for their match server
- **Fully Automatic**: No manual match creation or configuration needed - system handles everything

### 4. Individual Player Leaderboard

#### Player Statistics Tracking

- **Match Wins**: Count of matches won (player's team won)
- **Match Losses**: Count of matches lost (player's team lost)
- **Current ELO**: Current ELO rating
- **ELO Change**: ELO change over tournament
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average ADR (Average Damage per Round)
  - Total Damage
  - K/D Ratio
  - Other relevant stats
- **Match History**: List of all matches played with results

#### Leaderboard Display

- **Sorting Options**:
  - Primary: Match wins (descending)
  - Secondary: ELO (descending)
  - Tertiary: ADR or other performance metrics
- **Display Columns**:
  - Player name
  - Current ELO
  - Match wins
  - Match losses
  - Win rate
  - Average ADR
  - ELO change (since tournament start)
- **Real-time Updates**: Leaderboard updates automatically as matches complete

#### Tournament Winner

- **Primary Criteria**: Player with most match wins
- **Tie-breaking**:
  - Secondary: Highest ELO
  - Tertiary: Highest ADR or other performance metric
  - Additional criteria as needed

### 6. Tournament Results & Standings

#### Public Tournament Standings Page

- **Public Access**: No authentication required - any player can view
- **URL**: `/tournament/:id/standings` or similar public route

#### Round Flow

1. Round N starts → All matches created with balanced teams
2. Matches play → Players compete, results tracked
3. All matches complete → System detects completion
4. ELO updated → All player ELOs recalculated
5. Teams reshuffled → New balanced teams formed
6. Round N+1 starts → New matches created automatically
7. Process repeats until tournament ends

## Data Model & Relationships

### Player-Team Integration

- **Unified Player System**:
  - All players are stored in the `players` table
  - Players have ELO, stats, and match history
  - Players are the primary entity for shuffle tournaments
- **Team Import Creates Players**:

  - When bulk importing teams, system extracts players from team data
  - Creates players in `players` table if they don't exist
  - Links players to teams
  - Maintains single source of truth for player data

- **Team Creation Options**:

  - **Method 1**: Paste Steam URL (creates player if needed, adds to team)
  - **Method 2**: Select from existing players (uses players from players table)
  - Both methods ensure players exist in players table first

- **Benefits**:
  - No duplicate player data
  - ELO and stats tracked per player across all teams/tournaments
  - Easy to manage players centrally
  - Players can be reused across teams/tournaments

### Bulk Import Format

#### Players Import (CSV/JSON)

**CSV Format**:

```csv
steamId,name,initialELO,avatarUrl
76561198012345678,Player One,1500,https://...
76561198012345679,Player Two,1700,https://...
76561198012345680,Player Three,,https://...
```

**JSON Format**:

```json
[
  {
    "steamId": "76561198012345678",
    "name": "Player One",
    "initialELO": 3000,
    "avatarUrl": "https://..."
  },
  {
    "steamId": "76561198012345679",
    "name": "Player Two",
    "initialELO": 3200
  },
  {
    "steamId": "76561198012345680",
    "name": "Player Three"
  }
]
```

**Required Fields**: `steamId`, `name`  
**Optional Fields**:

- `initialELO` (defaults to the configured Default Player ELO if not specified - FaceIT-style default, 3000 by default)
- `avatarUrl`

**Note**: If `initialELO` is omitted or empty, player will be created with default Skill Rating of 1500.

#### Team Import (Modified)

- When importing teams, players are automatically extracted and created
- Team import format remains the same (as existing system)
- System processes teams and creates players in background
- Players are linked to teams after creation

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Tables

**`players` Table**

**If Using ELO**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Steam ID
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  current_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 3000, -- FaceIT-style default
  starting_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 3000, -- FaceIT-style default
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**If Using OpenSkill** (Recommended):

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Steam ID
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  -- Admin-facing "Skill Rating" (for compatibility and display)
  current_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1500, -- OpenSkill-aligned default
  starting_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1500, -- OpenSkill-aligned default
  -- Admin-facing "Skill Rating" (for compatibility and display)
  current_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1500, -- OpenSkill-aligned default
  starting_elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1500, -- OpenSkill-aligned default
  -- OpenSkill internal values
  openskill_mu REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 25.0,
  openskill_sigma REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 8.333,
  match_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**Note**:

- Default ELO (Default Player ELO) is applied when no ELO is specified during player creation
- If using OpenSkill, ELO is converted to OpenSkill (mu, sigma) internally
- Display uses OpenSkill's `ordinal()` converted back to ELO scale
- See [OpenSkill Integration](./openskill-integration.md) for conversion details

**`player_rating_history` Table**

**If Using ELO**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_elo_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  match_slug TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES matches(slug),
  elo_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
  elo_after INTEGER NOT NULL,
  elo_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
  match_result TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'win' or 'loss'
  performance_data TEXT, -- JSON with ADR, damage, etc.
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (match_slug) REFERENCES matches(slug)
);
```

**If Using OpenSkill** (Recommended):

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_rating_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  match_slug TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES matches(slug),
  -- Display values (for admin/UI)
  elo_before INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Converted from OpenSkill
  elo_after INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Converted from OpenSkill
  elo_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
  -- OpenSkill values
  mu_before REAL NOT NULL,
  mu_after REAL NOT NULL,
  sigma_before REAL NOT NULL,
  sigma_after REAL NOT NULL,
  match_result TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'win' or 'loss'
  performance_data TEXT, -- JSON with ADR, damage, etc.
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (match_slug) REFERENCES matches(slug)
);
```

**`player_match_stats` Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_match_stats (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  match_slug TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES matches(slug),
  team TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'team1' or 'team2'
  won_match BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  adr REAL,
  total_damage INTEGER,
  kills INTEGER,
  deaths INTEGER,
  assists INTEGER,
  -- Other stats as needed
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (match_slug) REFERENCES matches(slug)
);
```

**`shuffle_tournament_players` Table** (Tournament Registration)

```sql
CREATE TABLE shuffle_tournament_players (
  tournament_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES tournament(id),
  player_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  registered_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (tournament_id, player_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (tournament_id) REFERENCES tournament(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(id)
);
```

#### Modified Tables

**`tournament` Table**

- Add `overtime_mode: TEXT` ('enabled', 'disabled', 'metric_based')
- Add `team_size: INTEGER` (default: 5, number of players per team)
- Add `elo_template_id: TEXT` (references elo_calculation_templates table, nullable)
- Note: No bracket generation needed for shuffle tournaments (individual competition, not bracket-based)

**`matches` Table**

- Support matches without fixed `team1_id`/`team2_id` (nullable)
- Add `round_number: INTEGER` for shuffle tournaments
- Add `is_shuffle_match: BOOLEAN` flag

**New Match Structure for Shuffle**

- Instead of `team1_id` and `team2_id`, use dynamic player assignments
- Store player assignments in match config or separate table
- Track which players were on which team for each match

**Player-Team Relationship**

- Players and teams are separate entities
- Teams reference players from players table
- When teams are bulk imported, players are automatically created
- Players can exist without being on a team
- Players can be on multiple teams (across different tournaments)
- For shuffle tournaments, teams are temporary and players are the primary entity

## Algorithm Specifications

### ELO Calculation Algorithm

#### Package Recommendation

- **ELO Package Research**: See [ELO Package Research](./elo-package-research.md) for detailed analysis of available npm packages
- **Recommended Package**: `@echecs/elo` - Follows FIDE rules (official chess ELO standard), updated October 2024
- **Alternative**: `teslo` - TypeScript support, updated May 2025
- **Implementation Option**: Manual implementation is also straightforward (~10 lines of code)

#### Standard Chess ELO Formula

```
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_avg_elo - player_elo) / 400))
ELO Change = K * (Actual - Expected)

Where:
- K = K-factor (default: 32, standard chess ELO)
- Actual = 1 if team won, 0 if team lost
- Expected = Expected probability of winning based on ELO difference
- opponent_avg_elo = Average ELO of opponent team
```

#### Implementation Details

- **Win/Loss Based**: ELO changes based solely on team result
  - If player's team wins → Actual = 1
  - If player's team loses → Actual = 0
- **No Performance Adjustment**:
  - Individual performance metrics (ADR, damage, K/D) do not affect ELO
  - Keeps system simple and fair
  - All players on winning team get same ELO change
  - All players on losing team get same ELO change
- **Opponent Strength Considered**:
  - ELO change depends on opponent team's average ELO
  - Beating stronger team (higher avg ELO) = larger ELO gain
  - Losing to weaker team (lower avg ELO) = larger ELO loss
- **K-Factor**:
  - Default: 32 (standard chess ELO)
  - Configurable in tournament settings
  - Higher K = more volatile ELO changes
  - Lower K = more stable ELO changes

#### Example Calculation

```
Player ELO: 3000
Opponent Team Avg ELO: 3100
K-factor: 32
Result: Team Won

Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((3100 - 3000) / 400))
Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^(100 / 400))
Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^0.25)
Expected = 1 / (1 + 1.778)
Expected = 0.36

ELO Change = 32 * (1 - 0.36)
ELO Change = 32 * 0.64
ELO Change = +20.48 ≈ +20

New ELO: 3020
```

### Team Balancing Algorithm

#### Algorithm Research

- **Team Balancing Research**: See [Team Balancing Research](./team-balancing-research.md) for detailed analysis of algorithms and approaches
- **Recommended Approach**: Greedy Algorithm + Optimization Step (Xwoe-style)
- **Reference Implementation**: Xwoe Matchmaking Algorithm (https://github.com/Xwoe/matchmaking)
- **No NPM Package**: No dedicated npm packages found for team balancing - custom implementation needed

#### Greedy Algorithm Approach (Recommended for MVP)

```
1. Sort players by ELO (descending)
2. Initialize teams as empty arrays
3. For each player in sorted list:
   a. Calculate average ELO for each existing team
   b. Assign player to team with lowest average ELO
   c. If team is full (teamSize players), remove from consideration
4. Continue until all players assigned
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n + n \* t) where n = players, t = teams  
**Pros**: Simple, fast, works well for most cases  
**Cons**: May not find optimal solution

#### Optimization Algorithm Approach (Recommended for Production)

```
1. Use greedy algorithm for initial assignment
2. Calculate current ELO variance between teams
3. Iteratively swap players between teams
4. Accept swap if it reduces variance
5. Continue until convergence or max iterations
```

**Reference**: Xwoe Matchmaking Algorithm  
**Pros**: Better balance quality, tested in tournaments  
**Cons**: More complex, requires iteration

#### Alternative Approaches

- **Snake Draft**: Alternate team selection (simple but less optimal)
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolutionary approach (complex, good quality)
- **Full Optimization**: Find optimal solution (too slow for 60+ players)

#### Research Required

- Study existing team balancing algorithms (see research document)
- Test greedy algorithm with various player distributions
- Implement optimization step based on Xwoe algorithm
- Handle edge cases (odd players, extreme ELOs)

## Shuffle Tournament Flow Review – Findings _(Historical)_

**Date**: 2025-12-07  
**Branch**: `35-feature-new-tournament-type`  
**Scope**: End-to-end shuffle tournament flow (creation → registration → matches → progression → standings), checked against `shuffle-tournament-complex-solution.md` and current implementation at the time.

> **Note**  
> All issues identified in this document have since been addressed in code and documentation.  
> For the up-to-date status, see [Shuffle Tournament Implementation Verification](./shuffle-tournament-implementation-verification.md) and the admin guide [Shuffle Tournaments](../guides/shuffle-tournaments.md).

### 1. Tournament Standings Status & Progress Display

- **Issue**: The public standings page misinterprets tournament status and may hide round progress.
  - File: `client/src/pages/TournamentStandings.tsx`
  - Logic defines:
    - `isComplete = tournament.status === 'completed'`
    - `isActive = tournament.status === 'live' || tournament.status === 'started'`
  - Backend only uses `status` values: `'setup'`, `'in_progress'`, `'completed'` (no `'live'` or `'started'`).
- **Impact**:
  - In-progress shuffle tournaments are treated as **“Setup”** in the chip label.
  - Round progress bar and “in progress” indicators on the standings page never show for status `'in_progress'`.
- **Suggested fix**:
  - Treat `'in_progress'` as the “active” state:
    - `isActive = tournament.status === 'in_progress'`
    - Chip label color logic should also include `'in_progress'` as active, not “Setup”.

### 2. Overtime Mode: `metric_based` (Spec Only, Implementation Uses Enable/Disable)

- **Current behavior**:
  - The implementation supports **two** overtime options: `'enabled'` and `'disabled'`.
  - The public API, Swagger docs, and UI all expose only these two values.
  - `matchConfigBuilder` sets:
    - `mp_overtime_enable = 1` when `overtimeMode === 'enabled'`.
    - `mp_overtime_enable = 0` when `overtimeMode === 'disabled'`.
- **Spec vs implementation**:
  - Design docs (`shuffle-tournament-complex-solution.md`) still mention a potential `metric_based` mode (e.g. deciding winners based on total damage).
  - That mode is **not implemented** and is intentionally **not** part of the public API today.
- **Resolution**:
  - Treat `metric_based` as a **future idea** only.
  - Keep the public surface restricted to `'enabled' | 'disabled'` to avoid confusing admins or API consumers.

### 3. `defaultElo` in Shuffle Config (Removed from API)

- **Previous review finding**:
  - Earlier versions of the design/API mentioned a per-tournament `defaultElo` field for shuffle.
  - Implementation never actually used `config.defaultElo` when creating tournaments or players.
- **Current behavior**:
  - The shuffle tournament API **no longer exposes** a `defaultElo` field.
- Default player Skill Rating is controlled per-player (default 1500 via the OpenSkill mapping); there is no longer a global “Default Player ELO” setting in Settings.
- **Resolution**:
  - All per-tournament `defaultElo` references have been removed from the public API and docs.
  - This keeps behavior unambiguous: the global default ELO setting is the single source of truth.

### 4. Shuffle Match Card Player Display vs Stored Config Format

- **Issue**: Shuffle match cards attempt to render player lists as an **array**, but shuffle match configs store players as a **map** (`{ steamId: name }`).
  - Match config generation (`generateShuffleMatchConfig` in `matchConfigBuilder.ts`):
    - Reads `teams.players` JSON (stored as `Player[]`), then converts it into a MatchZy-style map: `{ [steamId]: name }`.
    - Resulting `config.team1.players` / `config.team2.players` are objects, **not arrays**.
  - Match card UI (`client/src/components/shared/MatchCard.tsx`):
    - Treats `configTeam.players` as an array:
      - Checks `configTeam.players.length`.
      - Calls `.slice(0, 3).map(...)` and expects elements with `{ name, elo? }`.
  - Because `configTeam.players` is actually an object, the array-based code path never executes; it falls back to showing `Team Name (N players)` using `expected_players_*`.
- **Impact**:
  - Shuffle matches **do not** show the intended “first few player names (+ELO)” line on the match cards.
  - This contradicts the intended UX described in the shuffle docs/verification (player-centric match display).
- **Suggested fix**:
  - In `MatchCard`, branch explicitly for shuffle matches:
    - Handle `configTeam.players` as either an object (`Record<steamId, name>`) or array.
    - Normalize to an array of `{ steamId, name, elo? }` before slicing/mapping, so names (and ELO when available) are shown as designed.

### 5. Minor Notes & Observations (Non-blocking)

- **Odd-player rotation fairness is limited**:
  - `shuffleTournamentService.generateRoundMatches` implements a rotation mechanism when an odd number of teams exists.
  - It correctly identifies players who played last round and tries to swap one of them out with someone from the “extra” team who did not play.
  - However, only **one swap per round** is attempted, and rotation is driven purely by the last unpaired team; players on that team who are never swapped may still sit out multiple rounds.
  - This is more of a **fairness/optimization limitation** than a direct bug, but it’s looser than the ideal “no one sits out twice in a row” goal in the complex spec.

### Summary

Overall, the shuffle tournament flow (creation, registration, automatic team balancing, match generation, round progression, and public standings/leaderboard) is implemented and largely consistent with the complex solution design.  
Historically, the main concrete issues were **status handling on the public standings page**, **incomplete/hidden `metric_based` overtime mode**, the **unused `defaultElo` field**, and the **match card’s incorrect assumption about shuffle player list format**. These have since been addressed or explicitly deferred (metric-based overtime), and the remaining gaps are mainly about future fairness/optimization improvements rather than correctness.

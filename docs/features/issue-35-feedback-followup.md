# Issue #35 – Shuffle Tournament Feedback Follow‑up

> **Context**  
> Follow‑up tracking doc for [Feature #35 – New Tournament Type](https://github.com/sivert-io/matchzy-auto-tournament/issues/35) and the commenter’s latest feedback (biggest concern: ELO system and how it fits the shuffle tournament mode).

---

## 1. What the contributor cares about (from issue + latest comment)

- **Individual‑focused competition**
  - Tournament winner is the **player** with the most match wins; teams are just temporary containers.
- **Fair, transparent rating system**
  - Wants ELO values that feel intuitive, comparable to their existing Excel‑based system.
  - Biggest concern is understanding **how ratings change** and whether that behavior matches expectations for this LAN format.
- **Configurable behavior**
  - Would like to be able to set **starting ELO per player**.
  - Ideally can control **how much stats influence rating changes** (similar to their Excel formulas).
- **Excel sheet as source of truth**
  - Has a complex Excel workbook used today for team balancing + ELO.
  - Is willing to share the sheet and even walk through it in a call so we can mirror the behavior more closely.

---

## 2. Current implementation snapshot (relevant to their concerns)

See also:

- `docs/features/shuffle-tournament-complex-solution.md`
- `docs/features/shuffle-tournament-poc-issue-35.md`
- `docs/features/elo-calculation-templates.md`
- `docs/features/shuffle-tournament-implementation-verification.md`

- **Rating engine**
  - Uses **OpenSkill** internally (mu/sigma) with conversion to a single display ELO (see `api/src/services/ratingService.ts` and [OpenSkill docs](https://openskill.me)).
  - Conversion is FaceIT‑style: admin/player sees a single ELO number; system stores mu/sigma.
- **Default behavior (“Pure Win/Loss”)**
  - Every tournament has an `elo_template_id`; if not set, UI defaults to `'pure-win-loss'`.
  - The **`pure-win-loss`** template is always present and enabled (`api/src/services/eloTemplateService.ts`), with all weights set to `0`.
  - With this template selected:
    - OpenSkill updates ratings purely from **team result (win/loss)**.
    - Individual stats are recorded but **do not affect** ELO changes.
    - History records `base_elo_after` and `stat_adjustment = 0` for transparency.
- **Customizable ELO behavior (templates)**
  - Admins can define **ELO calculation templates** that add a stat‑based adjustment on top of the OpenSkill change (`elo_calculation_templates` table, `eloTemplateService.applyTemplate()`).
  - Per‑stat weights (kills, deaths, ADR, utility damage, MVPs, etc.) and min/max caps are configurable.
  - Tournaments can select a template; only **enabled** templates affect ratings.
- **Shuffle tournament integration**
  - Shuffle tournaments share the same rating engine as other modes; ratings are **global per player**, not per‑tournament.
  - Leaderboard sorting matches the original request: wins → ELO → ADR.
  - Starting ELO per player can already be set on the **Players** page or via bulk import; default comes from global settings.

## 3. Open questions to clarify with the contributor

These will be asked in the public reply so we can tighten the design around their expectations:

1. **ELO concern focus**
   - Is the main worry that:
     - (a) The current rating behavior doesn’t match the **Excel formula** they’re used to,
     - (b) The system is not transparent enough about **how ELO is calculated/updated**, or
     - (c) Something else (e.g. volatility, fairness between rounds, global vs event‑only ratings)?
2. **Per‑event vs global rating**
   - For LAN shuffle tournaments, should ratings be:
     - Purely **per‑event** (fresh ladder each time), or
     - **Global** across events (current behavior), or
     - Global internally but with a way to show **“event‑only” deltas**?
3. **Excel parity**
   - How important is it that our stat‑based ELO templates **numerically match** their Excel sheet vs just behave similarly (e.g. “big impact from ADR, smaller from MVPs”)?
   - Which stats are most important to them (ADR, kills, deaths, utility damage, KAST, etc.)?
4. **Admin UX expectations**
   - Would they prefer:
     - A simple mode that **only cares about wins/losses** (current default), and/or
     - A more advanced mode where they can **tune weights** but with presets based on their sheet?
5. **Explanation needs**
   - What level of explanation is most useful: a short “how it works” paragraph in the UI, a more detailed doc, or even a per‑match “rating change breakdown” view?

---

## 4. Action items / TODO (including latest comment)

- [ ] **Review contributor’s Excel sheet**
  - Receive the Excel file via their preferred channel (Discord, email, etc.).
  - Do an initial pass to understand the core ELO formula, inputs, and intended behavior.
  - Optionally schedule a short call to let them walk through edge cases and take structured notes.
- [x] **Document default ELO behavior more clearly**
  - Add a concise “Default ELO mode (Pure Win/Loss)” explanation to `docs/guides/shuffle-tournaments.md` and/or the ELO templates page.
  - Make it explicit that with the default template, **only match result** drives ELO; stats are tracked but not used.
- [x] **Clarify ELO template selection in the UI**
  - In shuffle tournament creation, add helper text/tooltip explaining what the chosen ELO template actually does.
  - Highlight that “Pure Win/Loss” is the safest default and that advanced templates are optional.
- [x] **Decide on per‑event vs global rating story**
  - Based on the contributor’s answer, decide whether to:
  - Keep ratings global but improve documentation, or
  - Add explicit support for per‑event ladders / event‑scoped views.
- [ ] **Design a “Excel‑style” preset template (if desired)**
  - After understanding their Excel, model it as one or more ELO templates (e.g. “LAN – Excel‑style rating”).
  - Validate with them on test data before recommending it as a preset.
- [x] **Explore better transparency around rating changes**

  - Consider adding a UI surface (e.g. on the player page or match details) that shows: base OpenSkill change, stat adjustment, and final ELO delta.
  - Use existing `player_rating_history` fields (`base_elo_after`, `stat_adjustment`, `template_id`) as the backing data.

- [ ] **Add configurable MatchZy server ConVars (per server, surfaced in Settings/Servers UI)**
  - Goal: allow admins to edit core MatchZy settings like:
    - `matchzy_knife_enabled_default`
    - `matchzy_minimum_ready_required`
    - `matchzy_stop_command_available`
    - `matchzy_stop_command_no_damage`
    - `matchzy_pause_after_restore`
    - `matchzy_whitelist_enabled_default`
    - `matchzy_kick_when_no_match_loaded`
    - `matchzy_demo_path`
    - `matchzy_demo_name_format`
    - `matchzy_demo_upload_url` (already partially managed by the app)
    - `matchzy_chat_prefix`
    - `matchzy_admin_chat_prefix`
    - `matchzy_chat_messages_timer_delay`
    - `matchzy_playout_enabled_default`
    - `matchzy_reset_cvars_on_series_end`
    - `matchzy_use_pause_command_for_tactical_pause`
    - `matchzy_autostart_mode`
    - `matchzy_save_nades_as_global_enabled`
    - `matchzy_allow_force_ready`
    - `matchzy_max_saved_last_grenades`
    - `matchzy_smoke_color_enabled`
    - `matchzy_everyone_is_admin`
    - `matchzy_show_credits_on_match_start`
    - `matchzy_hostname_format`
    - `matchzy_match_start_message`
  - Backend:
    - [x] Extend server persistence to store per‑server MatchZy config:
      - Added `matchzy_config` JSON column on the `servers` table in `api/src/config/database.schema.ts` with a corresponding migration in `database.adapters.ts`.
      - Updated `api/src/types/server.types.ts` and `api/src/services/serverService.ts` so create/update requests accept a typed `matchzyConfig` object and serialize it into `matchzy_config`, and responses expose a parsed `matchzyConfig` back to the client.
    - [x] Add helper(s) to materialize a list of `matchzy_*` RCON commands from stored settings:
      - Introduced `getMatchZyServerConfigCommands` in `api/src/utils/matchzyRconCommands.ts` to turn a typed per‑server config into concrete `matchzy_*` commands (chat prefixes, knife toggle, minimum_ready_required, pause/stop behavior, whitelist, playout/reset, autostart mode, demo path/name/upload URL).
    - [x] Decide when to push these settings:
      - `api/src/services/matchLoadingService.ts#loadMatchOnServer` now:
        - Applies global MatchZy defaults (chat prefixes + knife toggle) via `getMatchZyCoreSettingsCommands` from `settingsService`.
        - Then loads any per‑server `matchzy_config` overrides for the target server and applies them via `getMatchZyServerConfigCommands`, so per‑server values win over globals.
        - All of this happens just before `matchzy_loadmatch_url`, ensuring each match load reapplies the desired config.
  - Frontend:
    - [x] Add UI for editing these settings:
      - Extended `client/src/types/api.types.ts` `Server` type with a `matchzyConfig` payload matching the backend shape.
      - Added a compact “MatchZy Overrides (optional)” section to `client/src/components/modals/ServerModal.tsx` that lets admins set per‑server overrides for `matchzy_chat_prefix`, `matchzy_admin_chat_prefix`, and `matchzy_knife_enabled_default` (with an indeterminate state meaning “inherit global default”).
    - [x] Wire API shape:
      - `ServerModal` now reads `server.matchzyConfig` when editing and sends `matchzyConfig` on create/update via `/api/servers` and `/api/servers/:id`.
    - [x] UX explanation:
      - The modal copy explains that these are optional MatchZy overrides and that leaving fields blank keeps using the global defaults from `Settings`.

### 4.1 Critical bugs from latest POC test

- [ ] **Server/Web state desync when server crashes (warmup / live)**

  - [ ] Reproduce crash scenarios (server killed during warmup and during live) and capture:
    - Match status in `matches` table.
    - Values of `matchzy_tournament_status`, `matchzy_tournament_match`, `matchzy_tournament_updated`.
  - [ ] Update backend status handling so UI can reliably detect a dead server:
    - Review `api/src/services/serverStatusService.ts` and `api/src/services/matchAllocationService.ts` to ensure offline/error states are propagated.
    - Make sure we clear or reset `server_id` on affected matches when the server is confirmed dead (or mark matches as needing reassignment).
  - [x] Update frontend views that show “Server Ready / Waiting for Players” to react to server offline / error:
    - `client/src/components/team/MatchInfoCard.tsx` now treats non-`online` server statuses the same as "no server assigned" when rendering `MatchServerPanel`, so the team view falls back to the “Waiting for Server Assignment” message instead of showing connect/copy actions for an offline server.
    - This keeps the tournament view in a clear waiting state while backend logic (restart/reallocation) handles reassigning a healthy server.

- [ ] **Server recovery: wrong map/settings after restart**

  - [x] Audit `api/src/services/matchLoadingService.ts` and `api/src/services/matchAllocationService.ts`:
    - `loadMatchOnServer` always loads from the canonical JSON config URL (`/api/matches/:slug.json`) and, before issuing `matchzy_loadmatch_url`, reapplies global + per‑server MatchZy settings via RCON. This guarantees that whenever a match is (re)loaded, the in‑game map/settings are sourced from the app’s current config rather than whatever was left on the server.
    - `matchAllocationService.startTournament` / `allocateServersToMatches` only ever call `loadMatchOnServer` after assigning `server_id` for `ready` matches; they never assume an existing in‑server config is correct.
  - [x] Decide on a consistent recovery strategy:
    - **Bulk restart**: `matchAllocationService.restartTournament` sends `css_restart` to all servers with `loaded`/`live` matches, then explicitly resets those matches back to `status = 'ready', server_id = NULL, loaded_at = NULL` and re‑runs the normal start/allocate flow. This chooses the “clear `server_id` and reallocate” strategy for tournament‑wide recovery, ensuring each match is freshly loaded on whichever healthy server the allocator picks.
    - **Single‑match restart**: `matchAllocationService.restartMatch` ends the current match on its server via `css_restart`, briefly waits for cleanup, sets the match back to `status = 'ready'` (keeping the same `server_id`), and then calls `loadMatchOnServer` to fully reload the config on that server. This covers the “re‑send correct config to the same server” path when an admin explicitly restarts a match.
    - **App restart / crash recovery**: `matchRecoveryService.recoverActiveMatches` runs on startup and syncs state from servers (match report + events) and reconfigures webhooks/demo upload, without changing `server_id` or reloading configs, so it won’t silently move matches between servers; instead it reconciles DB vs server for already‑running matches.
  - [x] Update admin tools (“Restart Match”) to clearly document what they do vs the automatic behavior:
    - `client/src/components/admin/AdminMatchControls.tsx` wires the “Restart Match” button to `POST /api/matches/:slug/restart`, which routes to `matchAllocationService.restartMatch`; the confirmation copy now clearly states that it “will end the match and reload it from the beginning” and that “all progress will be lost”, distinguishing this manual per‑match reset from the tournament‑level “Restart Tournament” button and from automatic startup recovery.

- [ ] **DB constraint error – duplicate `teams_pkey` after deleting/re‑adding player and resetting tournament**

  - [x] Inspect how teams are created and reused:
    - `teamService` only inserts into `teams` when explicitly creating/upserting named teams, and shuffle tournaments create their own temporary teams with IDs like `shuffle-r{round}-m{match}-team{1|2}`.
    - `createShuffleTournament` already clears out old shuffle teams via `DELETE FROM teams WHERE id LIKE 'shuffle-r%'` before inserting new ones, and bracket tournaments never auto-create teams (they reuse existing `teams` rows via `teamIds`).
  - [x] Fix reset logic so it fully cleans up any tournament‑specific teams and associations before recreating them:
    - Updated `tournamentService.resetTournament` so that:
      - For **shuffle** tournaments, it deletes all matches, clears `shuffle_tournament_players` for `tournament_id = 1`, removes any temporary shuffle teams with IDs matching `shuffle-r%`, and resets the tournament back to `status = 'setup'` **without** trying to regenerate a bracket (shuffle uses dynamic rounds instead).
      - For **non‑shuffle** tournaments, it keeps the existing behavior: delete all matches for `tournament_id = 1`, reset status to `setup`, then regenerate the bracket using existing team IDs, without touching user‑managed teams.
    - With this split reset path, temporary shuffle teams and registrations are always cleaned up before new ones are created, eliminating primary‑key conflicts on `teams` for shuffle flows while leaving normal team management unchanged for bracket tournaments.

- [ ] **Admin Tools – Server Events Monitor stuck on “Waiting for events…”**

  - [x] Verify backend events + sockets:
    - `api/src/routes/events.ts` (webhook ingestion).
    - `api/src/utils/matchzyRconCommands.ts` (remote log URL + headers).
    - `api/src/services/socketService.ts` (emitting `server:event`).
  - [x] Ensure at least one event path is wired for the POC:
    - Confirm MatchZy is sending events to `/api/events/:matchSlugOrServerId` with the right header.
    - Confirm `logWebhookEvent` + DB insert are working.
  - [x] Improve frontend feedback in `client/src/components/admin/ServerEventsMonitor.tsx`:
    - Show a clear “No events received yet – check webhook configuration” message if nothing arrives after N seconds.
    - Optionally surface the last error from `/api/events/test` or similar.

- [ ] **ELO calculation anomalies (winners losing ELO, huge swings, negative values)**

  - [x] Add logging around rating updates:
    - In `api/src/services/ratingService.ts` / `updatePlayerRatings`, per-player updates already log `oldElo`, `baseElo`, `statAdjustment`, `finalElo`, `eloChange`, `matchResult`, and `templateId` via `log.debug`, and a `log.success` entry summarizes how many players were updated for a given match.
  - [x] Re‑verify conversion constants and use:
    - `ELO_OFFSET` and `ELO_SCALE` implement the documented direct mapping from OpenSkill ordinal to our Skill Rating scale (ordinal * 200 + 1500) with `eloToOpenSkill` and `openSkillToDisplayElo`, and are only applied once on each conversion (no double offset/scale).
    - Sigma handling uses `DEFAULT_SIGMA` with a monotone decrease by match count and a floor of 2.0, matching the intended “more stable with experience” behavior.
  - [x] Check the currently selected ELO template for shuffle tournaments:
    - `api/src/services/eloTemplateService.ts` ensures `pure-win-loss` exists and stays enabled as the default.
    - `api/src/services/shuffleTournamentService.ts` persists `elo_template_id` from shuffle config, and `client/src/components/tournament/ShuffleTournamentConfigStep.tsx` / `client/src/pages/Tournament.tsx` default to `'pure-win-loss'` and only apply stat adjustments when a non-default enabled template is selected.
  - [x] Verify rating history queries and responses:
    - `api/src/services/ratingService.ts#getRatingHistory` returns `base_elo_after`, `stat_adjustment`, and `template_id` alongside before/after/delta fields.
    - `/api/players/:playerId/rating-history` in `api/src/routes/players.ts` exposes that data as-is.
    - `client/src/pages/PlayerProfile.tsx` consumes those fields in `ratingHistory` and surfaces them in the ELO History table.
  - [ ] Once Excel sheet is available:
    - Run the same sample matches through both the Excel logic and our engine.
    - Adjust template weights / scaling until changes are in a sane range and direction.

- [ ] **Double counting of wins/losses on player profile**

  - [ ] Check where rating history / match history rows are written:
    - `api/src/services/ratingService.ts` (inserts into `player_rating_history`).
    - `api/src/services/matchEventHandler.ts` (ensure `updateRatingsForMatch` is only called once per completed match).
  - [ ] Check `/api/players/:playerId/matches` implementation in `api/src/routes/players.ts` to ensure:
    - We don’t join the same match twice.
    - We don’t combine both team1/team2 records for the same player.
  - [x] Update `client/src/pages/PlayerProfile.tsx` aggregation logic if needed so wins/losses are calculated from unique matches:
    - Player profile now deduplicates match history rows by `slug` before computing wins, losses, win rate, and ADR aggregates, and before rendering the match history table and performance chart, so repeated `player_match_stats` rows for the same match no longer cause visible double counting.

- [ ] **Missing stats (match page, player profile, exports)**
  - [x] Confirm stats ingestion:
    - `api/src/services/matchEventHandler.ts#trackPlayerStatsForMatch` writes per‑player stats (ADR, damage, kills, deaths, assists, utility damage, KAST, MVPs, score, rounds played) into `player_match_stats` based on the latest `player_stats` event for each completed match.
    - `api/src/services/matchLiveStatsService.ts` maintains live match snapshots (including optional `playerStats`) for real‑time views without blocking match completion if stats are missing.
  - [x] Match page:
    - `client/src/components/modals/MatchDetailsModal.tsx` already renders per‑player “Player Leaderboards” when `liveStats.playerStats` is present, showing K/D/A, ADR, KAST, MVPs, damage, and linking to player profiles; when no stats are available it shows clear “No player data available” / “Waiting for stats...” messaging.
    - `client/src/components/team/MatchPlayerPerformance.tsx` uses the same `MatchLiveStats.playerStats` shape and gracefully hides itself when there are no rows.
  - [x] Player profile:
    - `/api/players/:playerId/matches` in `api/src/routes/players.ts` already returns `adr`, `total_damage`, `kills`, `deaths`, and `assists` per match from `player_match_stats`.
    - `client/src/pages/PlayerProfile.tsx` maps those fields into `matchHistory` and feeds them into both the “Match History” table and `PerformanceMetricsChart`, so ADR and damage now populate when stats exist, and display `N/A` when they do not.
  - [x] Tournament leaderboard:
    - Shuffle leaderboard (`getTournamentLeaderboard` in `api/src/services/shuffleTournamentService.ts`, exposed via `api/src/routes/tournament.ts`) computes `averageAdr` per player from `player_match_stats` and returns it on each entry.
    - `client/src/pages/TournamentLeaderboard.tsx` uses `averageAdr` in the “Top Players by ADR” summary, the “Avg ADR” column, and both CSV/JSON exports; when ADR is unavailable it shows `N/A` rather than misleading zeroes.

---

### 4.2 UI / UX improvements from latest POC test

- [ ] **Vanity URL feedback on Players page**

  - [x] In `client/src/components/modals/PlayerModal.tsx` and `/api/players/find`:
    - If the API returns 404 or a clear “Player not found / Steam API unavailable” error:
      - Show an inline error / helper text near the Steam input rather than failing silently.
    - Surface a distinct message when Steam API is not configured (from `api/src/services/steamService.ts#isAvailable`).

- [ ] **Steam API key error messaging**

  - [x] On `client/src/pages/Settings.tsx`:
    - When Steam key is missing or invalid and a Steam‑dependent feature fails:
      - Show a clear error (e.g. “Steam API key not set / invalid”) rather than a generic failure.
  - [x] Consider adding a “Steam connectivity check” button that pings a simple `/api/steam/status` route.

- [ ] **Dashboard “Recent Match Status” raw codes**

  - [ ] Identify where raw numeric codes are being rendered:
    - `client/src/components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx` (line charts / recent matches).
  - [x] Map internal status codes to human‑readable labels (Pending / Ready / Loaded / Live / Completed) and use those both for tooltips and any text display.

- [ ] **Tournament map order tile with a single map**

  - [x] In `client/src/pages/Tournament.tsx` / `client/src/components/tournament/TournamentFormSteps.tsx`:
    - Fix layout so the single map appears centered/normal instead of anchored at the bottom.

- [ ] **“Regenerate” button states**

  - [x] In the bracket / tournament creation views (`client/src/pages/Bracket.tsx`, `client/src/components/tournament/TournamentForm.tsx`):
    - Disable the “Regenerate” button until an initial bracket or match set is actually generated.
    - Add hover text when disabled explaining why.

- [ ] **Shuffle‑specific labels (bracket + match views)**

  - [x] Bracket page (`client/src/pages/Bracket.tsx`):
    - For `tournament.type === 'shuffle'`, hide or replace “Finals / Semi‑Finals” labels with something that makes sense for shuffle (e.g. just “Round X”).
  - [x] Match page / cards (`client/src/components/shared/MatchCard.tsx`, `client/src/components/team/MatchInfoCard.tsx`):
    - Hide “Series Maps Won” for shuffle matches where teams change each map.

- [ ] **Player profile – copy console command + ELO graph**
  - [x] Ensure “Copy Console Command” is wired correctly:
    - Reuse `MatchServerPanel` behaviour where `onCopy` populates a `connect` line and updates the `copied` state.
    - Check how `MatchInfoCard` is used in `PlayerProfile` and pass through the appropriate `onCopy` handler.
  - [x] ELO graph flat line:
    - Once rating history anomalies are fixed (see 4.1), confirm `ELOProgressionChart` in `client/src/components/player/ELOProgressionChart.tsx`:
      - Uses the `eloBefore`/`eloAfter` values from rating history correctly.
      - Shows multiple points when multiple matches exist.

---

### 4.3 Missing / useful features

- [ ] **Map selection – clear Active Duty maps when switching to Custom**

  - [x] In the tournament creation flow (`client/src/pages/Tournament.tsx`, `client/src/components/tournament/TournamentFormSteps.tsx`):
    - When the user switches map pool from “Active Duty” to “Custom”:
      - Clear the previously selected Active Duty maps.
      - Optionally show a small hint explaining that selection was reset.

- [x] **Overtime configuration presets**

- [x] Extend match / tournament configuration:

  - Add an OT amount dropdown (1 / 2 / 3 / Custom) where overtime is configured:
    - Implemented in shuffle configuration (`client/src/components/tournament/ShuffleTournamentConfigStep.tsx`) with presets and a custom field.
  - Map that to the right cvars in `api/src/services/matchConfigBuilder.ts` (e.g. number of OT segments).

- [x] **In‑game chat prefix + knife round toggles (tied to MatchZy ConVars)**

- [x] Chat prefix:
  - Surface `matchzy_chat_prefix` and `matchzy_admin_chat_prefix` in the MatchZy settings UI (see 4.0 ConVars section).
- [x] Knife round:
  - Surface `matchzy_knife_enabled_default` as a simple toggle for whether knife rounds are enabled by default.
- [x] Ensure these values are pushed via RCON before loading matches (see ConVars section).

- [ ] **Steam SSO (nice to have)**
  - [x] Design login flow (players only, keep admin model unchanged):
    - Added a Steam OpenID flow under `/api/auth`:
      - `GET /api/auth/steam` starts the Steam login by redirecting the browser to the Steam OpenID endpoint.
      - `GET /api/auth/steam/callback` verifies the OpenID assertion with Steam, extracts the Steam64 ID from `openid.claimed_id`, sets a lightweight `player_steam_id` cookie, and redirects the user to the built client at `/app/player/:steamId`.
    - This flow is intentionally **players-only**: it does not grant any admin rights and does not touch the existing API token–based `requireAuth` model for admin routes.
    - A simple `GET /api/auth/me` endpoint reflects the `player_steam_id` cookie (`{ authenticated: true, steamId }` or `false`) so the frontend can show “My Profile” style convenience UI in the future without using it for authorization.
  - [x] Update frontend routing / header:
    - On the public `FindPlayer` page (`client/src/pages/FindPlayer.tsx`), added a “Login with Steam” button (using `SteamIcon`) that simply navigates to `/api/auth/steam`, letting players jump directly to their own `/player/:steamId` profile without introducing a heavier sign‑in flow.

---

### 4.4 Questions / clarifications to resolve in the issue

- **API security**

  - [x] Double‑check that all admin routes are behind `requireAuth`:
    - Verified `requireAuth` is applied for `api/src/routes/tournament.ts`, `api/src/routes/servers.ts`, `api/src/routes/settings.ts`, `api/src/routes/maps.ts`, `api/src/routes/mapPools.ts`, `api/src/routes/teams.ts`, `api/src/routes/serverStatus.ts`, `api/src/routes/rcon.ts`, `api/src/routes/demos.ts` (except for the public demo upload endpoints which perform their own token validation), `api/src/routes/events.ts` (admin views), `api/src/routes/eloTemplates.ts`, `api/src/routes/templates.ts`, `api/src/routes/recovery.ts`, `api/src/routes/logs.ts`, and Steam admin tools in `api/src/routes/steam.ts`. Player‑facing pages (`/api/players/:id`, `/api/players/:id/matches`, `/api/players/:id/rating-history`, `/api/tournament/:id/leaderboard`, etc.) remain public as intended.
  - [x] Document in the reply (and possibly in `docs/guides/server-setup.md`) that:
    - Admin actions require the API token for all non‑public routes under `/api`.
    - Public endpoints are limited to player pages, standings/leaderboard views, and match/demo upload webhooks secured via per‑server tokens.
  - [x] Ask the reporter if they have any _specific_ concern (e.g. “can someone from the LAN spam X from their browser?”) so we can address real scenarios.

- **Match start logic / required players**
  - [x] Review how required players is currently implemented:
    - The app sets `expected_players_total` (and team‑side counts) in the generated match config for UI purposes, but **does not enforce** any additional “required players” logic in the backend.
    - Actual match start behavior is governed by MatchZy’s own ConVars:
      - We always send `min_players_to_ready = 1` and `min_spectators_to_ready = 0` in the match config.
      - The number of players that must be ready for the match to auto‑start comes from MatchZy’s `matchzy_minimum_ready_required` (which we only touch if explicitly configured via per‑server MatchZy settings).
    - Frontend components like `MatchInfoCard` and `MatchCard` read `config.expected_players_total` purely to show “All required players are connected. Match can start.” messaging; they do not affect when MatchZy actually starts the match.
  - [x] Try to reproduce/understand their case: 2v2 match configured, only 1v1 actually joined, match not auto‑starting.
    - In this situation, if `matchzy_minimum_ready_required` is higher than the number of players currently readied (e.g. still at a default tuned for 5v5), MatchZy will correctly refuse to auto‑start even though the UI shows “2 expected players”.
    - Because we don’t override `matchzy_minimum_ready_required` globally today, behavior is entirely dictated by the server’s MatchZy config.
  - [x] Clarify current behavior and recommended configuration:
    - Today the app’s responsibility is:
      - Reflect the **expected player count** in the UI (so admins can see when everyone intended is connected/ready).
      - Provide hooks to configure MatchZy’s ConVars:
        - Via global defaults in `Settings` for core options (chat prefixes + knife, already wired).
        - Via per‑server overrides (including `matchzy_minimum_ready_required`) in the Servers UI.
    - To make 2v2/3v3 formats behave intuitively at a LAN:
      - Set `matchzy_minimum_ready_required` per server to match the intended total players (e.g. 4 for 2v2, 6 for 3v3) or to a lower threshold if you want matches to start with partial lineups.
      - We’ll document this explicitly in the operator guide so it’s clear that auto‑start is ultimately controlled by MatchZy’s ConVars, not by our `expected_players_total` hint.

## 5. Notes

- Shuffle tournaments and the ELO engine are already **feature‑complete** and marked as **production ready**; this doc focuses on **clarity, alignment with the original Excel workflow, and admin confidence**, not on core correctness.
- All follow‑up work should be validated with the original issue author, ideally using their real‑world 60‑player LAN scenario.

# Managing Teams

## Adding Teams

### Single Team

1. Go to **Teams** page
2. Click **"Create Team"**
3. Fill in:
   - Team Name
   - Team Tag (2-8 characters)
   - Logo URL (optional)
4. Add players:
   - Steam ID or vanity URL
   - Player name
   - **Skill Rating (optional)** – Defaults to the system’s starting Skill Rating (1500) if not specified
   - Minimum 5 players required
5. Click **"Create Team"**

??? example "Advanced: Bulk Import (JSON)"

    For multiple teams, use JSON import:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "Team Pinger",
        "tag": "PING",
        "players": [
          { "steamId": "76561199486434142", "name": "Simpert", "elo": 3200 },
          { "steamId": "76561198765432109", "name": "Player2", "elo": 3100 },
          { "steamId": "76561198765432108", "name": "Player3" },
          { "steamId": "76561198765432107", "name": "Player4", "elo": 1500 },
          { "steamId": "76561198765432106", "name": "Player5" }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    **Note:** The `elo` field is optional. If not specified, players will be created with the default Skill Rating (1500). This is useful for shuffle tournaments where ratings are used for team balancing.

    **Download JSON Template:** [team-import-example.json](../TEAM_IMPORT_EXAMPLE.json)

    **Note:** Teams must be imported in JSON format. CSV import is not supported due to the nested player structure.

## Team Pages

Each team gets a public URL:

```
https://your-domain.com/team/team-pinger
```

Share this with teams - no authentication needed. They can:

- View upcoming matches
- Participate in map veto
- See live scores
- Get server connection info
- Monitor player connections

## Managing Players

### Adding Players

- Edit team → Add Player
- Enter Steam ID (Steam64, Steam32, or vanity URL)
- Enter player name
- **Set ELO rating (optional)** – Defaults to your configured **Default Player ELO** in Settings if not specified
- Configure a Steam API key in the dashboard **Settings** to enable vanity URL resolution

**Note:** When adding players directly to teams, you can set their initial Skill Rating. This is especially useful for shuffle tournaments where rating is used for team balancing. If no rating is specified, it defaults to the system’s starting Skill Rating (1500).

### Backup Players (Mid-Match)

If a player can't connect during a match:

1. Open match details
2. **Player Management** → Add Backup Player
3. Search for player
4. Select team
5. System executes `css_add_player` via RCON

## Replacing Teams

If a team withdraws mid-tournament:

1. Find replacement team
2. Click **"Replace in Tournament"**
3. Select team to replace
4. Bracket updates automatically
